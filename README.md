## Setup

**Setup parameters.yml**

Make sure you have an `app/config/parameters.yml`. If don't, copy `app/config/parameters.yml.dist` to get it.

Make any adjustments you need on configuration.

**Download Composer dependencies**

Make sure you have [Composer installed](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
before runing:

```
composer install
```

It is possible that you need to aditionally run `php composer.phar install`, depending on how you installed Composer.

**Setup the Database**

With `app/config/parameters.yml` all settled up, run:

```
php bin/console doctrine:database:create
php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load
```

In case of problems, completely drop the database (`doctrine:database:drop --force`) and try again.

**Dowload Webpack dependencies**

Use yarn to download webpack depenencies, required by front-end development

To install Yarn in OSX run:

```$ brew install yarn```

To install yarn in other OS check the [documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/es-ES/docs/install)

Then go to project folder and run yarn instalation to install dependencies

```
yarn install
```

**Start the built-in web server**

You can use Nginx or Apache, but the built-in web server works
great:

```
php bin/console server:run
```
